Release notes for 0,1-beta1 release

- Summary: now tested on MBR and GPT thumb drives (Ventoy bootable) booting in
      both Legacy and UEFI mode.

- Added these RELEASE NOTES

- Tweaked formatting and consistency of console output in numerous places
- Allow stronger --trace; using it twice traces sooner.
- Added function 'mkname' for the odd naming style of m.2 drives in Linux

- For sybak
- Now computes the size of the "firstfew" dd copy to be the smaller of 1MB or up to
      the first partition.  This preserves hidden code outside of any partition.  May
      miss some of MS Windows tricks if the drive was not shut down properly.

- For syres
- Dropped -U --nopart option which was nonfuncional anyway.
